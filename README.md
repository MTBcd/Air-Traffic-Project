# Air-Traffic-Project
Air Traffic forecast using Machine Learning 


This project aims to analyze and forecast air traffic data using different machine learning techniques: Prophet model (Facebook), NBEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Autoregressive Time Series), NHITS (Neural Hierarchical Temporal State), XGBoost, LGBM, and Random Forest. The analysis and forecasting are performed on the number of daily airline passengers departing from Paris Orly Airport.
